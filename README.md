# PomodoroClock
This is a Pomodoro clock made in Android and Kotlin. This is the first program I have made without following any tutorials at all.
The purpose of this project is to ensure I understand the basics of Kotlin programming. I tried to follow all the classic steps taken 
to prototype or create an application. I got the color pallet from Coolors.co, and the UI idea from Figma. 

I also created custom styles in this, and I'm starting to get a lot more comfortable with using XML alongside my code. It keeps the design part 
of any application so much more clean.

The syntax of Kotlin was confusing at the beginning, but I have gotten used to it and I'm starting to quite like it as well ;)
