# PomodoroClock

A Pomodoro clock, often referred to as a Pomodoro timer or Pomodoro technique, is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique is designed to help individuals improve their productivity and focus by breaking their work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

Here's how the Pomodoro technique typically works:

1. Choose a task you want to work on.
2. Set a timer for 25 minutes, which is known as one "Pomodoro."
3. Work on the task with full concentration until the timer rings.
4. When the timer goes off, take a short break, usually around 5 minutes. Use this time to relax, stretch, or do something unrelated to work.
5. After completing four Pomodoros (four 25-minute work intervals), take a longer break of around 15-30 minutes.

# Project Overview

This is a Pomodoro clock made in Android and Kotlin. This is the first program I have made without following tutorials.
This project aims to ensure I understand the basics of Kotlin programming. I tried to follow all the classic steps taken 
to prototype or create an application. I got the colour pallet from Coolors.co and the UI idea from Figma. 

I also created custom styles in this, and I'm starting to get a lot more comfortable with using XML alongside my code. It keeps the design part 
of any application so much more clean.

The syntax of Kotlin was confusing at the beginning, but I have gotten used to it and I'm starting to quite like it as well ;)
